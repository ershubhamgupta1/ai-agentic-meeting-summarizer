       "'1. Biological Differences: Cats are small carnivorous mammals while dogs are larger and are omnivores. They have different body structure and physiology.\\n\\n2. Behavioural Differences: Dogs are generally more social, active, and obedient. They are pack animals, which makes them more trainable. Cats, on the other hand, are more independent and less social. They prefer solitary activities and are less likely to follow commands.\\n\\n3. Maintenance: Dogs, especially larger ones, usually need more care and attention from their owners than cats. Dogs need to be walked regularly, are often more dependent on human companionship, and require a more structured feeding schedule. Cats generally have lower maintenance since they tend to be more self-sufficient, usually do not need to be walked, and can regulate their eating habits when given free access to food.\\n\\n4. Lifespan: Cats often live longer than dogs, particularly if they are indoor cats. The average lifespan of a cat can range from 12 to 15 years while for dogs it generally ranges from 10 to 13 years, though it can vary significantly depending on the breed.\\n\\n5. Communication: Dogs tend to be more vocal than cats, using barks, whines, and howls to communicate. Cats communicate more through body language, and while they do make noises like purring, meowing, and hissing, they are generally quieter than dogs.\\n\\n6. Affection Display: Dogs are more overt in showing affection, they may wag their tales, lick and jump. Cats are more subtle and may show affection by purring, gentle head-butting, or slow blinking. \\n\\nRemember, these points are generalizations and individual pets may exhibit different behavior and traits.'"
